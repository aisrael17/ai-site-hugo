Right now, I invest in early-stage fintech & blockchain businesses at [New Form Capital](https://www.newformcap.com/).

Before that, I did Excel and PowerPoint at Morgan Stanley. 

Before that, I studied stats & econ at Yale.

Most of my work is reading and writing and talking and listening and thinking. 

I'm a little too young and unwise to have anything useful to say, but in case that changes, I'd like to be prepared.
